# Neuromorphic-Digit-Classification
 Simple Python simulation of a one-hidden-layer spiking neural network for digit classification on sklearn's "digits" dataset.
 
**Output 1: Accuracy of the SNN in function of time**

Digit images are shown to the network at the **0.025 second time instant**, the inference accuracy of the network on the test set rises to **90%** in about **10 milliseconds**.
